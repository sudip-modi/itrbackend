5,"Provides a useful brief, easy to follow summary on initiating and planning projects.",3/1/2023
3,Material is very detailed which is both a positive and negative. It gets a little redundant and some things are just common sense. You can tell the instructor is trying to be upbeat but is very clearly reading off of cue cards so its a little flat. For a free course you get a lot of information and it is very easy to get a 100 on every quiz.,5/1/2023

5,The course is a fantastic refresher on basic principles of Project Management. Margaret Meloni presents material in an engaging format.

5,I love it! I am excited that it is an encouragement for me to enroll in and complete the specialization.,16/3/2023
3,The course is great resource of information. The biggest drawback is the need of using Flash to view most of the lecture. This limited my ability to went through the course on time - I attend Coursera courses using my iPhone while commuting and it is not possible for this course.,18/3/2023

3,"It isnt as engaging as I thought it would be. Since this is an introductory course, it would have helped if this were more interactive to build the interest for the latter courses.",7/4/2023
3,"The course, as intended probably, is theoretical and gives a good snapshot of project management. Following the PMBOK guide and covering all the relevant portions in the limited time deserves an applause. The only area of improvement, I felt, was the case study.It could have been a little more detailed and has scope of increased level of difficulty. A good course overall and beneficial in almost all walks of work :) Thank you !",9/4/2023
4,"Course goes over the most basic points, but also allows you (if you are interested) to dive much deeper into the content. Seems it has everything any project manager would want, so definitely worth taking. Would have wanted the questions to be a little more difficult and potentially more questions to help make sure the information was retained. Overall a great course.",11/4/2023

5,"course content was extremely good but week 7 exam was not up to the mark. I attempted the exam twice to came to know that two of the above means first and 2nd option not 3rd and last option. Also, some of the questions were very confused hard to understand. Test needs very much betterment",10/6/2023
4,"This course was extremely valuable to me. Theoretical knowledge especially. My two points for possible improvement, most probably subjective, would be:1.The course is too slow-paced. There is a bit too much of an auxiliary talk, which may distract from the essential knowledge.2.While the course offers some state of the art practical examples, a little more interactive approach would probably immensely increase student involvement and hence help keep attention and distinguish important points.Lastly, at every start of the week, I was asked to do a test quiz to asses my knowledge from that week. This is very strange. The test quizzes should most definitely be offered only in the end of a week, AFTER I have acquired knowledge, and not before.",12/6/2023
5,"I would like to thank Coursera and the University of Michigan for this amazing resource. The course is a great opportunity to acquire essential knowledge to better prepare and perform in negotiation situations, and to be more efficient on daily situations.",14/6/2023

4,"This is a very dense course, offering a quite detailed information and technique on negotiation.

5,Great course! It was an opportunity for me to delve into negotiations despite my engineering background.,4/7/2023
4,"The course is great, but the title was misleading for me. I would call it Contract Negotiation, because there is a lot of information on the laws and the specifications of contract signing that I think are too specific to be present in a general negotiation course. Other than that, the teacher is great and the tests/exams also allow for a continuous notion of our progression.",6/7/2023

5,"Great course! Everything is perfectly structured, and thanks to George, its easy enough to assimilate.

5,"I learned a lot of techniques that I can use not only in business/ work-related negotiations but also to my personal day-to-day transactions. Thank you very much, Prof. George Siedel!",15/8/2023
5,"One of the best real life course, that has a lot of practical and technical knowledge which most negotiators think they have but really do not know or understand it. It puts our thought process in a scientific way to negotiate with people and to understand how the other person will think and try to trap you. There is a lot of practical examples which helps you to change your way of negotiation. I am glad I took this course and will implement these techniques, in my daily life.",17/8/2023

As a psychologist with no background in law or economy, I struggled at times with course material.
